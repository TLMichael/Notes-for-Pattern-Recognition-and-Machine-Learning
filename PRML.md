# Chapter 2 : Probability Distributions
- **density estimation**: To model the probability distribution p(x) of a random variable x, given a finite set x1, ..., xn of observations.
- **parametric distributions**: Binomial and multinomial distributions for discrete random variables and the Gaussian distribution for continuous random variables.
- **nonparametric density estimation**: These models contain parameters, which controls the model complexity rather than the form of the distribution. Such as histograms, nearest-neighbours, and kernels.

# Chapter 3 : Linear Models for Regression
- **basis function**: The simplest form of linear regression models are also linear functions of the input variables. However, we can obtain a much more useful class of funtions by taking linear combinations of a fixed set of nonlinear functions of input variables, known as *basis functions*.
- **linear models**: Linear models have significant limitations as practical techniques for pattern recognition, particularly for problems involving input spaces of high dimensionality, but they have nice analytical properties and form the foundation for more sophisticated models to be dicussed in later chapters.
